            <p>1Form is Australia's leading online tenancy application system, providing over 85% of the real estate industry nationally with the fully customisable Application Management System (AMS). The AMS allowed your business to make the entire tenancy application process paperless and assists your staff by providing online tools to help manage the process.<br><br>

            Often acting as the ‘face’ of 1Form, I frequently met with both existing and prospective clients to train their staff in our programs or present our services. When the opportunity arises I flew interstate to speak at property management conferences to promote 1Form’s services to our target audience.<br><br>

            I was the the main contact for our key franchise Head Office contacts including, (but not limited to):
            - First National
